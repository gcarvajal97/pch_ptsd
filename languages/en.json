        "q13body2": "Is your child having a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep many nights? Is your child afraid to sleep alone?",
        "q14title": "Is still having pain or discomfort", 
        "q14body1": "Most injured children have pain, at least at first. Pain cannot always be managed completely, but doctors do their best to get it under control as soon as possible.", 
        "q14body2": "Your child may tell you they are in pain, or you might see the effects of pain in their behavior. Pain can make it harder to sleep and harder to concentrate. Follow up may be needed if your child’s pain is getting worse or if it interferes with getting a good night’s sleep or paying attention in school.",
        "q15title": "Has had other behavior changes since the injury", 
        "q15body1": "Many times behavior changes are temporary reactions to injury-related stresses and to normal life being turned “upside down”, at least for while. Frustrations or worries can lead to clingy or angry behaviors. Some head injuries can also lead to behavior changes (be sure to ask your child’s doctor about what to expect).", 
        "q15body2": "Are behavior changes making it harder for your child to get along with people or to get back to regular activities? Have these changes lasted for more than a few weeks?",
        "q16title": "Is having trouble with returning to school or other activities", 
        "q16body1": "Returning to school may require physical accommodations (such as getting around on crutches). Stress and worry can sometimes make it harder to concentrate on schoolwork. And after an injury, there may be changes (at least for a while) in your child’s ability to participate in sports and other activities they enjoy.", 
        "q16body2": "Are you worried about how things will go when your child returns to school? Is your child having trouble keeping up with schoolwork? Is your child very upset about missing out on sports or other activities because of the injury?",
        "q17title": "Brothers or sisters are upset or worried", 
        "q17body1": "Injury can affect the whole family. When a child is hurt or in the hospital, brothers and sisters may be worried, frightened, or even angry. It’s hard for parents to meet everyone’s needs at the same time.", 
        "q17body2": "You may notice that your other children are missing your attention, or that they are upset or worried.",
        "q18title": "You (parent) are stressed or worried yourself", 
        "q18body1": "After your child is injured, there are lots of things that you as a parent have to cope with. It’s normal for parents to feel stress and to be concerned about the future. Many parents also have some traumatic stress reactions in the first few weeks. If these don’t get better in a month or so, they may signal a problem that needs attention.", 
        "q18body2": "Have these feelings lasted for more than a month? Are worries about your child keeping you from being able to concentrate, get enough sleep, or get back to work or other activities?"
