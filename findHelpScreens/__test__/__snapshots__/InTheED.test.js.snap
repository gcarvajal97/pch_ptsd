    Being in the Emergency Department can be a scary and stressful experience for injured children and their parents. Parents have many worries and questions and it can sometimes be difficult to get all of the answers right away. Communicating well and often with the ED medical team about your child will help them provide your child with the best possible treatment. It can also help you play a more active role in your child's care.

    1. You are the best person to help your child. Be calm and reassuring. Hold his hand; distract him with a story or game, etc. If needed, set rules and limits like you would at home.

    2. Help your child understand what is happening. Make sure that the healthcare team explains things in a way your child can understand. Be honest but reassuring about what will happen. ('This will hurt now, but it will help you get better.')

    3. Allow your child to talk about worries or feelings. Encourage your child's healthcare team to talk with your child directly. As much as possible, let your child answer for himself. Do not force your child to talk, but be there to listen when he is ready.
