    1. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Some parents keep a pad of paper to write down their questions. This way, when the health care team comes to examine your child, you will be prepared. If you don't understand the answer, let the medical team know and ask, again. Ask your doctor to write down the name of your child's injuries.

    3. Be sure to let the medical team know of any pre-existing medical conditions, other special needs and fears, and allergies your child has, as well as whatever you can tell them about how the injury happened.

    4. You are your child's most important advocate – ask how you can get involved in your child's care and when you can make decisions about treatment. Let your health care team know if your child is in pain.

    5. Take time for yourself. It is important to take breaks as often as you need them. Take a shower; make some phone calls; get something to eat or drink; or go to the chapel to think or cry – whatever it is that you need for yourself. After your break, you will feel better able to support your child. Let your child's health care team know when you leave your child's bedside and when you return.
