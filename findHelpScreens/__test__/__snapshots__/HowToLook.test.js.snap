    If you are wondering how to find a child therapist, a good place to start is to talk with your child's doctor or a counselor at your child's school. They can help you figure out the best way of helping your child and your family, and may be able to suggest a counselor or therapist experienced in helping children with traumatic stress.

What is your approach to working with this type of problem? What is your success rate? How do you work with parents?
