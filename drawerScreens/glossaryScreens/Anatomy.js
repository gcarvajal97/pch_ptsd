                    The kidneys are bean-shaped organs located just under the 
                    rib cage in the back, one on each side. They are responsible 
                    for filtering the by-products of our bodyâ€™s metabolism from 
                    the blood and removing this waste as urine.{"\n"}

                    The liver is a large organ located under the ribcage in the
